# Image-Classification-using-CNN
Implenting convolutional neural networks in order to classify images of cats and dogs

I couldn't add the data file as if was pretty huge. You can easily get the images of cats and dogs and store them in 2 different folders. Split the same folders into training and testing data sets and put all the folders in 1 single folder. I believe you will be able to find the readily available datasets online. If not, please reach out to me and I will provide you the dataset.

Involves
1) Data pre-processing
2) Building CNN layer by layer
3) Training the CNN model
4) Making a single image prediction
